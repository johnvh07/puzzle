# TODO for uploader:

- Don't allow videos longer than 2 seconds.

- Cache upload password in localStorage.

- If an iPhone user turns their live photo into a bouncing video, then throw away the second half.

- Allow cropping

- Preview the currently selected range and crop bouncing (to help make smooth bounces)
